They say they will boycott school until their demands are accepted.  Protests are taking place in other cities, too.  Students want to cut in half the annual charge of 20,000 to 320,000 leks   180  2,915 .  Education Minister Lindita Nikolla announced that the double payment for repeated exams would be canceled but said the government could do nothing about the fees.  Students said they would continue the protest until all their demands were fulfilled. They are also asking for better accommodation and representation on the universities  decision making bodies.  Thousands of Albanian students rallied on Friday for a fourth day of protests demanding lower tuition fees, a hike in the national education budget and improved campus facilities.  The biggest demonstration was held in the capital Tirana, with other smaller protests gripping universities in the cities of Korca, Elbasan and Durres.  Tuition in Albania s public universities ranges from 160 to 2,560 euros annually    significant sums in a poor country where the average monthly salary is around 350 euros.  The student anguish was stoked by a recent government decision to charge extra fees for re taking exams.  After several days of protests the government announced it would rescind the fees.  Public university students protesting in the Albanian capital have turned down offers to negotiate with the government, saying their demands must be met first.  Students on Saturday defied the rain and increased their demands, also turning down support from the political opposition. They have blocked a main street in front of the Education Ministry and some parents have joined them.  The protesters declined to meet with Education Minister Lindita Nikolla, who noted that the government cannot solve all of their demands since tuition fees are set by the universities themselves.  The student s main demand is to cut tuition fees in half. The cost to take bachelor courses in Albania now ranges from 20,000 to 45,000 leks   180  410  per year.  On a student Twitter page, the protester urged Nikolla and Prime Minister Edi Rama   to choose wisely   and accept their requests. Some people brought food and water to the students in a show of support.  The prime minister of Albania has failed to convince protesting public university students to sit down to talk about their demands.  Students said on Monday their demands must be met first. Those include cutting tuition fees in half, doubling the budget for education and a greater student presence on decision making boards.  Public university students protesting the cost of tuition fees have gathered for the largest rally to date, threatening to escalate it unless their demands are met.  Thousands of students on Tuesday held posters, blew vuvuzelas and shouted   Lower the tariffs!   in front of the Education Ministry. Students from other cities and Tirana high schools joined them in a peaceful protest.  Thousands of Albanian university students took to Tirana s streets on Tuesday for their biggest show of strength yet in a protest movement demanding lower tuition fees and more investment in public education.  The protests, which kicked off last week, are the biggest mobilisation of university students since demonstrations in 1990 against the former communist regime, according to local media.    Our demands are not negotiable, the government must accept them or we will radicalise our movement,   Ilir Curri, a 21 year old student from Shkodra University in the north, told AFP.  "

At night, Hamza Khater eats and sleeps at a volunteer run shelter. He spends his days hanging around the international bus stop next to the Gare du Nord.

Mehdi Kassou, an organizer for a volunteer group that provides shelter for about 500 migrants each night, estimates that about 45 percent of them are Sudanese. Their presence reflects the latest phase in a migration crisis that has disrupted politics in one European country after another. It also leaves the center right government of Belgium, which is set to hold elections next year, struggling to reconcile its legal and humanitarian obligations with its   tough but fair   rhetoric on migration, and a determination to avoid large scale migrant camps in the capital. Seeing unauthorized migration rise in Brussels last summer, the Belgian government ordered a series of heavy handed raids on informal camps and homeless shelters. Those raids    along with falling temperatures    have largely succeeded in breaking up camps in public parks, and received wide popular support. Even so, hundreds of Belgian families have reacted by inviting migrants into their homes.  Last month, the government proposed police raids on the houses of citizens suspected of sheltering unauthorized migrants.  Medical charities are providing food, clothes and assistance, and volunteers have set up shelters like the one where Mr. Khater sleeps, in a former office building. The total cost of sheltering one migrant is about 10 euros per night, organizers estimate. There have been several demonstrations against the government policies, and about 3,000 people formed a human chain around migrants at the Gare du Nord last month to prevent a police raid.

Davor Dragicevic s former wife, Suzana Radanovic, has taken over leadership of the vigils, telling of relentless harassment by the authorities, whom she and Mr. Dragicevic accuse of shielding David s killers and obstructing the investigation.   They won t break me. They won t scare me. I am guided by my child,  Ms. Radanovic said at the vigil on Thursday. But even she acknowledged that what began in the spring as a desperate plea for information by grief stricken parents had grown into a politicized struggle.  The protest movement has emerged as a challenge to the authoritarian influence of Milorad Dodik, the longtime leader of the Serb ministate who has held the Serb position in Bosnia s tripartite presidency since general elections in October.

Radev, who will head the Bulgarian delegation at the COP24 UN climate talks next week in the Polish city of Katowice, said that measures to limit climate change were   necessary and urgent.      But these measures have to be kept within the framework of what has already been agreed, and there should be no increase in the commitments,   he said.  Around 1,000 coal miners and power plant workers demonstrated in Sofia on Thursday to protest against calls for increased carbon cutting measures.  Podkrepa trade union chief Dimitar Manolov said tens of thousands jobs were at stake if Bulgaria is forced to shut down its Maritsa East power plant, one of the most polluting plants in Bulgaria and the 11th dirtiest in Europe.    We want to preserve the coal energy industry as it is now,   Manolov told AFP.  Hundreds of Bulgarian coal miners and energy workers protested on Thursday to demand government guarantees that their jobs will be preserved amid bids by the European Union to close mines and tackle climate change.  Buses carried protesters from across Bulgaria for the march in downtown Sofia, where some 2,000 demonstrators chanted   victory   as they marched to the headquarters of the EU offices in Bulgaria and rallied there Thursday.  Bulgarian miners say the EU s timeframe for closing down coal mining and coal extraction is too short and argue it should not come at the expense of the bloc s poorest and most carbon dependent regions.  Union leader Dimitar Manolov said 150,000 jobs are at risk should the biggest coal mines and energy plants in southeastern Bulgaria close down.  "

Found in a search of 2016. Coded as a single long protest lasting about nine months. The times article says this has been nine months of continuous protest. This is also described asa sit in.  Thousands of people will join protest marches today against reform to France s labour laws, but President Hollande is said to be more alarmed by a nocturnal revolt spreading from Paris. For nine nights, more than a thousand people have gathered until dawn at the Place de la R publique, the symbolic heart of French democracy, in a display of anger with the government and political system. La Nuit Debout  up all night  has spawned parallel sit ins in 30 towns and cities, including Nantes, Toulouse and Rennes. Since Thursday several hundred Belgians have also occupied a square in central Brussels.  Night on our feet, prime minister Valls on his knees,  demonstrators chanted in Paris last night. So far the citizen s movement, which includes debates and street theatre, has been a mainly festive communion of the discontented young. However, the government fears that the sit ins, which began spontaneously after the showing of an anti capitalist documentary film, could become a French version of New York s 2011 Occupy Wall Street, or Spain s indignados, the mass protest that gave birth to Podemos, the rising radical left party.  Something new is starting,  Fr d ric Lordon, an economist, said.  The ruling class wants to keep our issues separate, our agenda divided. We say today that we are united around a global and universal agenda.  Mr Hollande, whose pro market reforms lost him the support of much of the left,  is frightened of having to face a youth movement that could spread like wildfire,  a senior Socialist said. Le Figaro, a conservative newspaper, said:  Fran ois Hollande  and Manuel Valls can t get to sleep any more.  The government has called the occupiers  utopian ideas  legitimate  but its spokesman, St phane Le Foll, said that the protesters could not think that they had  a monopoly on the truth . Leaders of the students  union, which is staging marches against the labour reforms, have kept their distance from the unstructured occupations. Fran ois Ruffin, whose documentary sparked the movement and is its unofficial figurehead, called for a wider protest that would bring in disaffected people across France.  Coded as a single demonstration that lasts nine months due to a lack of information about each protest as well as the language of sit ins.   Beer cans littered the ground, the smell of cannabis hung in the air, house music blared out and the talk was of an uprising to bring about a new society. The sun had long since set over central Paris and more than 2,000 protesters had gathered for the 22nd consecutive night in a movement that is drawing comparisons with celebrated French revolts of the past. Nuit Debout  Night Up , as the sit in is called, began as a protest against President Hollande s plan to reform labour laws to lengthen France s 35 hour working week and to make it easier for companies to lay off staff. Parisians have gathered each night for more than three weeks in the Place de la R publique to envisage a better world. The heady atmosphere has so far been peacefulIAN LANGSDON EPA It has turned into something much wider and more alarming for Mr Hollande. Nuit Debout may have no leaders, no organisational structure and only the vaguest of aims   to make the world a better place. It has, however, caught on to the extent that there are now similar protests in dozens of other cities in France and beyond. It has become the French equivalent of Occupy Wall Street or Madrid s anti austerity indignados   a sprawling, anarchic, left wing gathering that is a magnet for popular discontent and a festive counter culture.  There are denunciations of   speciesism,   of multinational corporations, capitalism, G.M.O.s, the police and nuclear power. There are pleas for Julian Assange and African workers. There are drumming, guitar playing, free soup and 20 somethings swigging beer. A jolly ragged man, unsteady on his feet, takes the microphone to denounce   words, words, words.   Another announces, mysteriously,   We ve got to be on the side of the dominated!   This is France s newest political movement, open every night to the public on a main square in Paris, the Place de la R publique, which has been transformed into a giant outdoor sit in recalling the demonstrations of May 1968 in multicultural form. The plaza has been packed with young people every night for nearly a month, venting their anger    at just about everything. The news media here cannot seem to get enough of the movement, which calls itself Nuit Debout    or   Night, Standing Up      a phrase some in the movement say is inspired by the 16th century writer  tienne de La Bo tie s line,   They are only tall because we are on our knees.   Others say it comes from the   Internationale,   the hymn of the 19th century revolutionary left. But the movement is more than just a freewheeling free for all of inchoate frustration. On Thursday night, the protest at the Place de R publique took a violent turn as police arrested several dozen demonstrators when they refused to disperse at midnight. Some of the protesters threw blocks of concrete and glass bottles at the police, who responded with tear gas. At other protests across France, 24 police officers were injured, three seriously. At a moment when disgust with mainstream parties is high, the movement is also being observed warily by the country s politicians, who recall how such citizen protests led to potent political parties in Spain and Italy All through March students and unions took to the streets to demonstrate. The protests spread to the provinces. The government quickly backed down, gutting its own plan..The police fired tear gas during clashes last week at the Place de la R publique. The Nuit Debout protests represent a range of causes including migrants  rights and anti globalization. "

She was not carrying out a formal inspection, they said. Police said that the woman fell into a pond 200 metres from the farm in sub zero temperatures and had a heart attack. Officers said that there was bruising on her body.  She probably tried to resist,  one said. A murder inquiry was launched and Xavier Espinasse, 47, was arrested. His brother was questioned as a witness He said that Mr Espinasse had given a  very vague explanation .

Hundreds of protesters have camped out in the Place de la R publique in central Paris, which they say they will vacate only when the labour bill is withdrawn. The legislation will encourage employees to work more than the statutory 35 hour week and make it easier for companies to lay off staff. Government economists say that it will remove two of the barriers that stop companies from hiring people. The reform has infuriated the left, however, which regards it as a betrayal of the principles that President Hollande had pledged to uphold when he was elected. Last month Mr Hollande removed some of the most contentious aspects of his proposals, such as a cap on redundancy pay, but opponents say that they will call off the protests only when the legislation is scrapped.

The officers fought about 200 anticapitalists and eco warriors in an attempt to clear a protest camp in western France which has come to symbolise resistance to the state.  One officer was wounded in the eye by a flare in skirmishes that began when squadrons of riot police moved in at dawn at Notre Dame des Landes, near Nantes. They fired tear gas at protesters who hurled petrol bombs in retaliation and tried to block the officers  advance with burning barricades of tyres and wooden pallets.  Bulldozers were brought in to demolish a colony of about 100 huts and makeshift homes that protesters have built since moving into the rural site in 2008 to block construction of an international airport to serve the Atlantic coast. After years of dithering by previous governments, President Macron scrapped the airport project in January.  Most of the protesters left after that, but a band of anarchists demanded the right to remain on land that they had turned into a utopian experiment in autonomous living. An initial attempt to expel the protesters in 2012 had failed.    A group of 30 to 50 people are continuing to attack the security forces with projectiles   stones, rockets and petrol bombs,   G rard Collomb, the interior minister, said earlier.  The protest camp, which its supporters called the ZAD  zone to be defended , came to symbolise hard left and anarchist rejection of   the system  . It has spawned similar ZADs, protected by militants  barricades, in other parts of the country.  "

Then 13 more 19th century houses came down in June, wrought iron balconies and all, leaving only bare asphalt baking in the summer heat in Perpignan, a city near France s border with Spain and close to the Mediterranean coast.  Finally, the residents of the city s old Saint Jacques district had endured enough. Well over 50 dwellings in their neighborhood had been reduced to rubble since 2015.  Late last month, they gathered in the district s ancient square high on a hill, as a city excavator was making another mess of bricks and jagged wall fragments nearby.  Dozens marched from there down to the prefecture, the central government s representative, demanding to be heard. City Hall backed down. The excavator was withdrawn, the demolitions left at a standstill.  What made the events exceptional was not just that this was a stand by one of the poorest neighborhoods in France. It was also a protest by a unique population, one the French media and academics universally refer to as  les gitans,  or Gypsies.  The Gypsies of Perpignan, who speak Catalan, appear to be distinct culturally from the broader population of Roma, sometimes also referred to as Gypsies, but they are in many ways no less maligned and marginalized in France.

It was prompted by protests by farmers who were trying to block the racecourse with bales of hay. The police used tear gas to disperse them 30 kilometers into an unusually long 218 kilometer  135.5 mile  stage through the Pyrenees mountains that included five major climbs.  The stage, which was marred by several crashes on steep, narrow and fast descents, was won by Julian Alaphilippe, a French rider on the Belgian Quick Step team who is also the leader in the climbing competition.  Protests by farmers and trade unionists have frequently blocked or delayed the Tour and other major races. In recent years, efforts have been made in the Pyrenees by sheep farmers angered by the reintroduction of bears to the mountains. Perhaps the most famous incident occurred in 1984 when Bernard Hinault, a five time winner of the Tour, punched a shipyard workerwho was part of a protest over layoffs that stopped the early season Paris Nice race.

"," More than a quarter million people across France joined protests on Saturday against planned hikes in gas taxes. Drivers blocked roundabouts, highway access roads and intersections.  The demonstrations have harnessed a broader discontent with high taxes and, for some, with the policies of President Emmanuel Macron.  Most of the 2,000 demonstrations were in the suburbs, exurbs and rural areas of France where people rely on their cars to go to work, visit the doctor and do their grocery shopping. Some protesters also blocked access to border crossings.  Most of the protests were orderly, though one person was killed and more than 200 were injured in accidents or altercations around the country, according to the Interior Minister, Christophe Castaner.  In Paris, some 1,200 demonstrators almost reached the Elys e, the presidential residence, where they shouted,  Macron quit,  and blocked the Champs  lys es. Protesters at roadblocks clashed with police and motorists for a second day yesterday as the revolt over President Macron s fuel tax rises caused chaos across France.  A 63 year old woman was killed on Saturday when she was hit by a car at a protest in the Alps.  The   yellow vest   demonstrators   named after the hi vis jackets they have adopted as their emblem   promised to continue the disruption over the coming days and weeks.  Their warning raised the pressure on Mr Macron, who has swatted aside unions opposed to his reforms but is struggling to contain the rebellion that has crippled French highways.  He has been criticised for failing to foresee that his efforts to counter President Trump by putting the environment at the heart of his agenda would so exacerbate anger in provincial France.  The protest was intended at first to be a one day event but spilt over into yesterday and now threatens to drag on further, to the alarm of ministers. On the Facebook groups that started the campaign, more than 10,000 people have said they will take part in another protest in Paris next Saturday. The more radical demonstrators have demanded that the president dissolve the National Assembly and call a snap general election.  In Saint Quentin in eastern France, a protester was taken to hospital with serious injuries after a motorist tried to drive through a roadblock. In Nancy, also in the east, and Caen in Normandy, riot police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators who had refused to put an end to roadblocks. Protesters also turned out at Disneyland Paris, forcing staff to open the gates to the car park, which usually costs  EURO 30 a day, and allow visitors in free. Many of the protesters were pensioners, whose taxes have increased as Mr Macron tries to shift the fiscal burden from those who work to those who do not. With them were drivers objecting to a 21 cents per litre rise in diesel fuel tax over the past eight years, and who face another 6.5 cents rise in January.   "

A hard core of   yellow vest   campaigners, named after the hi vis jackets they have taken as their emblem, targeted strategic points as they disrupted roads for a third day in an attempt to force the president to ease fuel taxes.  More than 400 people have been injured in three days of protests. On Saturday a 63 year old woman was killed when a car hit her at a roadblock and yesterday a young protester was seriously injured when hit by a lorry in Saint Dizier in the northeast.  Traffic was blocked yesterday at refineries and fuel depots in the Aude d partement near Marseilles, at Valence in the southeast of France and at Valenciennes in the north. About 200 lorries were halted on the road to a fuel depot in the western city of Rennes.  Dozens of roundabouts and motorway ramps were barricaded by giletsjaunes as they are known, around cities including Strasbourg, Lille, Rennes, Toulouse and Marseilles.  In the southern Dr me d partement on Sunday night, a drunk protester was arrested after he fired a gun into the air and drove at other protesters who had tried to remove him. Mr Macron faces criticism over a reform programme that has left him branded as a leader for the rich. Yesterday s protests were far smaller than Saturday s, when 300,000 protesters set up 2,000 roadblocks, but  douard Philippe, the prime minister, fears that the spontaneous protest, organised on Facebook and other social media, could harden into a long term challenge to the state.  Support grew online yesterday for a protest in Paris this Saturday after Mr Philippe refused in a Sunday night television interview to bend to protesters  demands. Eric Drouet, an organiser in Seine et Marne, to the east of Paris, urged people to converge on the Place de la Concorde, near the  lys e Palace.  Police are alarmed because as the protesters showed last Saturday, they have the ability to mass as a group in central Paris, with no union organisers or police authority, and travelling simply as individuals.

POIRIER  "," On Saturday, thousands of so called Yellow Jackets, named for the fluorescent road safety vests that all French drivers must carry in their vehicles, converged on Paris for a second weekend to protest a rise in fuel taxes and to express general discontent with the fiscal burden in one of the most highly taxed states in Europe, where taxes represent over 45 percent of G.D.P.   Protests in France began last weekend, with hundreds of thousands demonstrating against fuel tax hikes.   The numbers had dropped sharply from the preceding week s several hundred thousand protesters; the police estimated there were about 8,000 in Paris and more than 80,000 across the country on Saturday. But this time, more were concentrated on the protesters  symbolic targets: the capital and Mr. Macron himself.  Clouds of gas and smoke rolled up the Champs  lys es all afternoon as the police battled militant members of the crowd wielding paving stones; the grass roots protesters insisted they were unconnected with their movement.   We re just fed up. It seems like to us that the government is only working to maintain its own privileges,  said Mathieu Styrna, one of the thousands marching down the Champs  lys es. A contractor, he said he had been forced to drive hundreds of miles a week for work and could no longer afford his gas bills.  For the protesters, it was all about making ends meet.   Why should we have to finance their projects?  Mr. Styrna said, referring to the government s plan to discourage car use through gas taxes. Many in the crowd said that they did not disdain the government s environmental goals, but that their own survival was more important.  The movement appears to be without leaders, and the opposition parties in France have scrambled to keep up with it.  Almost 300,000 people took part in the Nov. 17 protests, blocking roads and highways. One protester was killed, run over by a panicked driver taking her child to the hospital and whose car had been set upon by angry people in yellow vests. The abnormally high number of casualties  600 people were injured  in a country that has long mastered the art of theatrical but safe demonstrations was disconcerting. A week later, the protesters gathered again, though in smaller numbers, with thousands coming from around the country to demonstrate in Paris.  "

The   Yellow Vest   protests   spurred by an increase in the gasoline tax, and named for the roadside safety vests worn by the demonstrators   have emerged as a spontaneous outcry over declining living standards.  On Sunday, Mr. Macron returned to Paris from the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina and went to the Arc de Triomphe to assess the damage after rioters defaced the landmark.  On Saturday, roughly 75,000 people took to the streets across the country in a third act of the protest. In Paris, yellow vest supporters torched cars, attacked shop windows and clashed with police. Local authorities announced that at least 92 people were injured in Paris, including 14 police officers.  Trying to quell its most serious political crisis, the government of President Emmanuel Macron announced on Tuesday that it would suspend the gasoline tax increase that had set off three weeks of increasingly violent protests in Paris and around France by the so called Yellow Vest movement.  The step was an extraordinary concession by a president who has been criticized as remote and unempathetic, and who has refused to bend to previous protests and plummeting poll numbers as he pushes through changes that he insists are necessary to make France s economy more competitive.

Although the protests have been modest in size, they have been unusual in their spontaneous and widespread nature, and have received enormous support on social media and near constant coverage by the French news media.  The movement has so far failed to name representatives who could negotiate with the government. A meeting between Mr. Philippe and moderate members of the Yellow Vests was canceled on Tuesday after two of them said they had received death threats from within their own movement.

The so called Yellow Vests descended on the capital by the thousands, even as the police turned out in force, blocking off roads and monuments.  Nearly 1,400 people were arrested nationwide. In Paris, many were detained before they could even reach the central site of the demonstrations along Paris s main artery, the Champs  lys es.  The huge police presence in the capital   absent last Saturday   appeared far more able to contain the violence. The show of force reflected a change from preceding weeks, with law enforcement often engaging with the vandals before they could act.  Act Four in the weekly   yellow vest   protests unfolded Saturday in Paris amid a now familiar backdrop of tear gas and chants, but it also brought further clarity on where the rage is headed: directly at President Emmanuel Macron.  What began as opposition to a carbon tax designed to curb climate change has morphed into a working class revolt against Macron, who now faces the first major test of his presidency and whose approval ratings have plummeted to all time lows.  The crowds on Saturday   several thousand demonstrators   appeared smaller than in past weeks. Approximately 290,000 people protested during the first weekend of demonstrations last month, fewer than half that amount took to the streets last weekend and even smaller crowds turned out Saturday. By evening, the Interior Ministry said about 125,000 people joined protests across France, with approximately 10,000 demonstrators in Paris.  "

The ranks of protesters dwindled after Mr. Macron this week promised tax cuts and wage increases to mollify the Yellow Vests, who are angry over the cost of living and high taxes. It was still not clear whether Mr. Macron was able to convince many of the protesters, as he struggles to address an unstructured and leaderless movement with myriad grievances. Several people said that weariness from weekly protests   and a growing reluctance to attend potentially violent demonstrations   had chipped away at the number of protesters.  The demonstrations have become  a bit repetitive,  Mr. Billot said.  Demonstrating every Saturday doesn t help the movement.

What started two months ago as a protest over gas taxes has turned into a more general attack on the French government.  The minister, the chief government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux, told French television that Yellow Vest protesters and   men dressed in black      the so called casseurs, or   breakers,   who have latched onto the movement    commandeered a construction vehicle and broke down the door of the Left Bank building. They then entered a courtyard and broke several windows, he said.  The rare intrusion    the last such attack on a government building by protesters was in 1999    took place on a day of protests throughout France that started peacefully but degenerated into violence. Some 50,000 took part in Yellow Vest demonstrations all over France, officials said Saturday, up from last weekend s 29,000. Over 3,000 turned out in Paris.  The numbers were down sharply from the protest s first weeks, but still represent a significant national turnout, especially as a majority of French continue to support the movement, despite repeated outbreaks of violence.  The Yellow Vest movement, which takes its name from the fluorescent hazard vests adopted by the protesters as a sign of economic distress, began as an outcry over rising fuel taxes and expanded into a broad campaign over money woes.  Near the Mus e d Orsay in Paris, the police used tear gas and flash balls to block hundreds of protesters. Video posted to social media showed protesters fighting hand to hand with club wielding police officers. Protesters dragged two officers to the ground and kicked them repeatedly, the video showed.  On the Champs  lys es, which was closed to traffic for hours, protesters threw rocks at the police and officers used a water cannon to disperse the crowd.  Scooters and a car were burned along one of the capital s symbols of wealth and prestige, the Boulevard Saint Germain. Protesters and the police clashed on a pedestrian bridge linking the two banks of the Seine, a span heavily visited by tourists.  Underscoring the seriousness of Saturday s protests, President Emmanuel Macron reacted sharply and quickly on Twitter.   Once again, the republic was attacked with extreme violence    its guardians, its representatives, its symbols,   Mr. Macron wrote.  Skirmishes also broke out between the police and protesters in major cities in western France, including Nantes, Bordeaux and Caen. In Rennes, the capital of Brittany, protesters broke a door to city hall. In Toulouse, 2,000 people took to the streets. Paving stones were thrown at the police, and highways were blocked.

Georgia s Prime Minister Resigns After Protests and Party Infighting, The New York Times, June 13, 2018 Wednesday 17:40 EST, Length: 593 words, Byline: Ivan Nechepurenko  "," Demonstrators rallied in Georgia over the weekend over an issue new to street protest movements in the former Soviet countries: a demand to legalize recreational drug use.  Though the protesters were quickly dismissed by their opponents as deadbeats and drug addicts bent only on keeping up their own habits, Georgia s government took the movement seriously enough both to negotiate and to move water cannons into position in the streets of the capital, Tbilisi.  Drug laws in former Soviet countries, even those that in other ways lean politically toward the West, like Georgia, tend to be far harsher than in Western Europe.  The activist group behind the protests, White Noise, first formed in 2013 to defend a man facing eight years in prison for possessing about two ounces of marijuana. That case, against Beka Tsikarishvili, eventually ended with a fine, but White Noise has gained traction by rallying support for others facing long prison terms.  The protests this weekend were set off by police drug raids on two clubs on Friday evening. Crowds gatheredSaturday and Sunday and called for the resignation of Georgia s prime minister. They drew attention in the wake of street actions in neighboring Armenia that had toppled a leader seeking to stay on beyond his term limit. Speculation swirled that the protests might snowball and threaten the governing party, Georgian Dream.  But while the protests raised the profile of the White Noise group and its cause of liberalizing drug laws, they did not spread beyond young people.  Earlier in May, Tbilisi was the scene of a different kind of protest. Thousands of young people gathered in front of Parliament to protest against a heavy handed antidrug police raid on two nightclubs in the capital.

The Berlin State Senate banned Hezbollah flags at the march. Berlin state Interior Minister Frank Henkel defended the flag ban, saying Hezbollah missuses the right to assemble because the group  propagates the destruction of an entire people and endorses war and violence.  International Quds Day   initiated by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic s founder, in 1979   is an annual event calling for the destruction the Jewish state.  This demonstration  al Quds Day  is directed at a state that represents the same values as Germany and the other countries of Europe,  said Yakov Hadas Handelsman, Israel s ambassador to Germany, at a counter al Quds Day demonstration on Saturday.  And therefore this demonstration today is not only directed at Israel. The demonstration is directed not only against Jews in the entire world. No, the demonstration is directed against the entire Western world and its values.  The number of pro Israel protesters ranged from 260 to 500. Hadas Handelsman said it is a  disgrace  that for the last 20 years in Germany, agitating publicly against Jews and Israel is allowed.  The counter demonstration is not codeable as it does not make a clear demand of the state."

What began late Saturday as a peaceful demonstration in the German capital led by groups associated with anti fascist and far left movements ended in violence outside a disputed building. Members of the leftist groups and their sympathizers have been protesting the gentrification spreading into Berlin neighborhoods that have been home to squatters for decades. The Berlin police said they had deployed 1,800 officers, nearly a third of them brought in from outside the capital, and used a helicopter to monitor the protest in an effort to maintain the peace. But as the demonstration progressed into the evening, the number of protesters swelled to 3,500 and some began lobbing cobblestones, firecrackers and glass bottles at the officers, injuring 123, the police said in a statement. Officers responded with pepper spray and billy clubs to push back surges of demonstrators, some of whom were masked. Eighty six people were detained on suspicion of disturbing the peace, resisting arrest, causing injuries and the illegal use of explosives, the police said. Most were released. The demonstrators and the authorities blamed each other for the escalation of violence, set against the backdrop of angry demonstrations and the burning of dozens of cars since June 22, when the police carried out evictions at a house occupied by squatters in Berlin s Friedrichshain neighborhood. About a half dozen cars were set on fire on Saturday night, the police said. Some were burned close to where the disturbances broke out, and others were set on fire in wealthier neighborhoods elsewhere in the city. "

After an attack on a young man wearing a kipa in a trendy Berlin neighborhood, the leader of Germany s largest Jewish organization urged Jews to wear baseball caps instead. It was just too dangerous, he said, to walk around openly with a kipa or skullcap, a sign of devotion.  In a country that has spent 70 years fighting the legacy of the Holocaust, the backlash was swift: We are all kipa wearers. Berliners, including the mayor, and other Jewish groups participated in demonstrations on Wednesday in which people of all faiths donned skullcaps in solidarity.   Today the kipa is a symbol of the Berlin that we would like to have,  Mayor Michael M ller told a crowd of hundreds of people outside the Jewish community center in western Berlin. It is, he said,  a symbol of tolerance.   Officials from Chancellor Angela Merkel s government, political parties ranging from the far right to the far left and the Turkish community, attended the rally. Smaller demonstrations were held in the eastern cities of Erfurt and Potsdam, as well as Cologne in the west.  In such a climate, many fear, shows of solidarity will go only so far. The demonstration of support in Berlin was held on a street cordoned off by police. As they left the area and passed the police line, many demonstrators could be seen taking their skullcaps off.  Jews and non Jews staged kippa wearing solidarity marches in German cities on Wednesday evening in response to an assault last week by a Syrian refugee of Palestinian descent against a man wearing a kippa.  The man assaulted was actually an Arab Israeli who was testing whether wearing a kippa in Berlin would lead to an antisemitic attack.  In Berlin, more than 2,000 people participated in the kippa march, a police spokesman said, while rallies were also held in Cologne, Erfurt, Magdeburg and Potsdam.  "

Police said that 800 people gathered at a monument to Karl Marx in the centre of Chemnitz on Sunday after various groups called for a demonstration in response to the killing on Saturday. A Facebook post by a far right football fan group called Kaotic Chemnitz said:   Let s show who s in charge in this town.   It was shared hundreds of times.  The police were unable to contain the crowd and video footage showed demonstrators chasing immigrants through the streets. People were understood to have been kicked to the ground.  Yesterday the police remanded in custody a 23 year old Syrian man and a 22 year old Iraqi on charges of manslaughter in connection with the killing of a 35 year old German man after a verbal altercation. Two other Germans with him were stabbed and seriously injured.  Protesters flashing Nazi salutes and shouting   Foreigners out   clashed Monday night with counterdemonstrators chanting,   Refugees welcome,   in a second night of violence in the east German city of Chemnitz that left several people injured and a country dismayed over images of rioting.  The police in Saxony said on Tuesday that several people had been treated for injuries sustained in the clashes Monday night. Ten people are being investigated for giving the Hitler salute, they said.  The violence first broke out on Sunday, after nationalists and far right soccer fans called on supporters, including on social media, to take to the streets to   defend   their country from immigrants after the killing of a 35 year old German man.  Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her condolences to the victim s family and condemned the violence, telling reporters in Berlin on Tuesday that she had seen videos of demonstrators   going after people, riotous assemblies and hate in the streets.    Germany was shaken by the worst far right rioting since 1992 when police with water cannon failed to stop thousands of neo Nazis and other extremists chasing immigrants, hurling bottles and fireworks, giving Hitler salutes and chanting   foreigners out  .  The clashes erupted on Monday night after 6,000 far right protesters and 1,000 counter demonstrators massed in the eastern city of Chemnitz after the stabbing of a man at the weekend, allegedly by two migrants. Police appear to have been surprised by the numbers and struggled to contain the disorder, despite deploying water cannon and tear gas. At least 20 people were injured as fireworks and other objects were hurled by both sides.  "

Pushing their way into the heart of a forest that has existed for 12,000 years, where some 60 treehouses have been built over the past six years, thousands of police officers began cutting trees to reach a central community called  Oaktown.  They tore down at least one treehouse and detained more than a dozen protesters, on the ground and in the trees, the police said.  In recent weeks, environmentalists have drawn attention to the mine, which is operated by the energy company RWE in the Hambach Forest, east of the city of Aachen, in an effort to highlight the disparity between Germany s pledges to reduce its carbon emissions and uphold its commitments to   the Paris climate accord and the country s heavy use of its only significant natural resource, soft coal, or lignite.  The police set the stage to clear protesters from the trees on Thursday, after the state government of North Rhine Westphalia declared that the treehouses, many more than 80 feet off the ground, violated local fire codes. They ordered local municipalities to clear the structures in order  to protect the bodies and lives of their dwellers,  the city of Kerpen said in a statement.  The Aachen police said that protesters had built barricades, some of which they set alight, and emptied the contents of their toilets from the treehouses onto officers below.  Protesters have insisted the only threat comes from RWE, which has expanded the coal mine to the point that it now covers more than 90 percent of the forest, which once stretched over nearly 10,000 acres. For the past six years, protesters have been actively squatting in the remaining 250 acres of trees, which RWE plans to begin clearing in October.  "

Many of them are young people who were inspired by the protest movement in Spain.  B1  People demonstrating against austerity measures in Greece made their feelings known in Athens on Tuesday. ; 3   Public opposition in Greece to the government s austerity drive has been increasing over the last week. Daily protests in front of Parliament have been relatively small but are growing. The rallies, in Athens and other major cities, have been modeled on a Spanish campaign that brought thousands of mainly young protesters to city squares and have been organized through social networking sites without the involvement of labor unions, which usually lead Greek demonstrations. ; 4   Thousands of Greeks, including many young people, filled the main square outside Parliament for a 10th day Friday, calling on the government to revoke the austerity measures and for foreign creditors to   go home.

While some analysts say the protest movement that has camped out on the square since May 24 is losing steam, that wasn t evident last night... ; 10   The upstart crowd camped out on Syntagma Square in front of the Greek Parliament is like no other in Greek history. Yes, it is rough around the edges. No, it does not have solutions to the years of debt and corruption that have Greece near default. Yet since May 24, the movement organized through social media has continued to swell and turned heads as a new voice of the people, the power of the Greek powerless. Critically, it is largely nonviolent. On Tuesday, however, the violent fringes smashed windows and drew shots of tear gas from riot police. But this protest movement has been one of baby strollers and roasting corn rather than molotov cocktails, skinheads, or communist red flags. The only flag is Greek.

The governing coalition of Alexis Tsipras,  whose radical left Syriza party came to power promising not to introduce further austerity, commands a wafer thin majority, and was all too aware before the vote last night that defeat could bring it down To secure parliament and ensure an orderly vote, 2,000 police officers had faced off against an estimated 20,000 protesters who gathered outside the sprawling stone building waving red flags and shouting anti government slogans. A three day general strike has paralysed the country The reforms include a significant overhaul of the country s pension system, with a phasing out of supplementary benefits for the poorest pensioners, and an increase in social security contributions of as much as 300 per cent. The national pension will be cut by 40 per cent, to  EURO 384 a month. Many families in Greece have relied on a grandparent s pension to survive the financial crisis. "

Sticks and stones fly as Macedonia s name is too much for Greeks to bear  The Times  London   June 18, 2018 Monday, Edition 1, Scotland, Length: 512 words  Byline: Greece Anthee  "," A landmark agreement to change the name of Macedonia and end a decades old dispute with Greece appeared to be on track on Friday, but it was becoming increasingly clear that few people in either country were terribly happy about it.  The announcement of the agreement on Tuesday prompted the main conservative opposition party in Greece, New Democracy, to call for a vote of no confidence against the government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, plunging Parliament into an acrimonious debate that forced Mr. Tsipras on Friday to abandon plans to brief lawmakers on the naming deal.  Greece has long objected to its northern neighbor s use of the name Macedonia, arguing that it implies territorial aspirations against a northern Greek region with the same name, and represents an attempt to appropriate the ancient civilization of Macedonia, the center of the kingdom of the Greek warrior king Alexander the Great.  Outside Parliament, protesters waved Greek flags and condemned the deal as a  national betrayal  and suggested that the compromise was a final straw after years of what they regarded as humiliating austerity measures.   They ve taken everything, but not our Macedonia. We re not giving it away,  said Aliki Voutsa, 63, a retired schoolteacher.  They have no right to give up our history, our heritage.   In recent months, there have been large rallies against a compromise on the issue of Macedonia s name in Athens and other major cities   including Greece s second city, Thessaloniki, the capital of the Greek region Macedonia. Organizers of the rally in Athens on Friday called for a referendum on the deal and promised an  unending struggle.    A demonstration in Athens on Friday against the agreement reached with Macedonia on that country s name change.   Thousands of protesters rallied outside Parliament during the debate, waving Greek flags and chanting anti government slogans. Scuffles broke out, with riot police firing tear gas to stop protesters from breaching police lines.  A protester against a deal between Greece and Macedonia to rename the former Yugoslav republic, in Athens on Saturday. Protesters gathered outside parliament yesterday shouting   Macedonia is Greek  , unfurling banners and singing folk songs. Organisers said the demonstrations would continue throughout a 48 hour parliamentary debate. Tomorrow hundreds of thousands of Greeks are expected to converge and protest at a signing ceremony for a deal in Prespes, a scenic and sleepy lakeside border town in northern Greece.  Riot police fired tear gas to disperse protesters who hurled sticks and stones and shouted   traitors   in an attempt to break through the first of about 20 cordons ringing the area.  Acrid plumes of smoke smothered the lush forest, forcing some protesters to flee. Some older demonstrators suffered breathing problems and others fainted. Dozens climbed trees, while some wearing motorcycle helmets and black clothes fought with police for more than three hours. The authorities said that 12 people had been injured and were being treated at local hospitals.  At least 5,000 demonstrators including monks, nuns and clerics flooded the region of Prespes from daybreak, waving giant flags and unfurling banners in the latest protest against a deal that they claim humiliates Greece. Under the deal, Greece s northern neighbour will be renamed   North Macedonia   but its language and people can be called Macedonian   which is what residents of the northern Greek region of the same name call themselves.

Riot police fired tear gas on crowds of protesters trying to break through a security cordon and storm the gates of the parliament building.  Demonstrators threw rocks, flares, firecrackers and paint, forcing crowds to retreat as smoke engulfed the city centre. Most demonstrators refused to leave, singing the national anthem before turning on more than 2,000 police officers guarding the building.  They tried to climb the fence as monks, nuns and protesters holding giant icons of the Virgin Mary accosted the authorities, accusing them of being   traitors   for not defending Greece.  The protests, which organisers said drew 200,000 people to the capital from around the country, start a climactic week that could break the government of Alexis Tsipras and block Macedonia s hopes of joining the European Union and Nato.  Police said at least nine officers were injured in clashes as loudspeakers blared,   Hands off our Macedonia   and   We will never give up our identity  .    This issue isn t about nationalism, or far right populism,   Nikos Vazikaris, who drove 175 miles from the southern city of Mani to protest, said.   It s about who we are ... That s all we have left.   He accused the government of   selling out   Greece s   identity and future  . Organisers said that 3,000 busloads of protesters had come to Athens, making a turnout of at least 200,000.

Late Thursday night, Mr. Tsipras addressed Parliament holding a manuscript s worth of papers in a blue folder.   We are one step away from a very historic event after almost 30 years of inactivity and one national concession after another,  he said during his more than 70 minute speech.  Outside, a few thousand demonstrators gathered. Some threw Molotov cocktails but police in riot gear, who seemed to outnumber them as midnight approached, fired back with tear gas.  In the north of Greece where opposition to the deal is most fervent, protesters have targeted the homes of members of Parliament from Mr. Tsipras s leftist Syriza party. On Wednesday night, some threw firebombs at the home of Theodora Tzakri, a lawmaker. The attack caused damage but no injuries.  Public opposition to the deal was also clear last Sunday, when tens of thousands protested in Athens in a rally that culminated in violence as groups of right wing extremists tried to force their way into the Parliament, injuring 25 police officers with clubs and firebombs.  The demonstrations on Thursday were organized by far left groups that contend Western powers are imposing the Macedonia deal on Greece. The Communist Party draped a giant banner on the walls of the Acropolis, saying,  No to the plans of USA NATO EU.   "

More than 10,000 people gathered on Heroes  Square in Budapest on Wednesday to support the university and protest another law proposed by the Orban government, this one targeting nongovernmental organizations with foreign financing. Mr Orb n, whose Right wing government has been in power since 2010, has in recent weeks faced some of the biggest demonstrations seen in Hungary since the end of communism.  Demonstrators protest against Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban s government in front of the former building of Hungarian Television on April 15, 2017   The regulation of higher education is a member state competency, not the EU s.   Zoltan Kovacs, a Hungarian government spokesman, told The Telegraph.   We maintain the main reason behind everything that has been coming at us now, and for the past year and a half, is about illegal migration and the fundamental differences in approaches between us and the Commission.     Tens of thousands of people demonstrate in Hungary 00:57  Just as the higher education bill became law, Hungary s government introduced legislation forcing NGOs to declare any funding over  19,780 a year and label any publication they produce that is foreign funded.

We have to consistently stand up for our values,   activist Katalin Lukacsi told the crowd.   We have a future. It is ours, and we won t give it up.   The European Union has initiated legal proceedings against Hungary over the university issue. Orban says the government merely wants to eliminate   advantages   that Central European University has over other Hungarian universities.

The protests, held in Budapest and several other cities, are unlikely to prompt the newly elected government to change course, but they reflect the deep divisions in this Central European country that has been at the forefront of a regional drift away from liberal Western values.   Democracy is just inconceivable without the rule of law and free media,  said one protester, Levente Biro, 24.  We ll march as long as needed.   The demonstrations came a week after Mr. Orban and his Fidesz party secured a convincing victory in national elections, their power seemingly on the ascent. The political opposition is in disarray, civil society is under attack and the news media is almost fully under the control of the state.

The protests began on Wednesday as a reaction to two new laws: one that forces employees to work up to 400 hours of overtime a year, and a second that created a parallel judicial system that will severely undermine judicial independence.  By Sunday, the demonstrations had become a catchall protest against many aspects of Mr. Orban s increasingly autocratic governance.  The protesters, whose numbers peaked at an estimated 15,000 on Sunday, held relatively small events, given that Mr. Orban was re elected in April with nearly 50 percent of the vote in an election that observers said was free but not fair.  But analysts were struck by the rare unity of the protesters, which included several parties from across Hungary s fragmented political spectrum, and also by their persistence. They braved below freezing temperatures, despite being branded as treasonous agents of George Soros, the Hungarian American philanthropist, by most major private and public media outlets,   which are mostly controlled by allies of Mr. Orban.  Around 2,000 protesters marched several miles through the snow to the edge of Budapest late Sunday night to gather outside the state media headquarters, which has become a symbol of Mr. Orban s government because of its constant support for the prime minister s agenda.   Factory of lies,  the crowd chanted outside the building, before being sprayed with tear gas by riot police officers.   Hungary s odd week began last Wednesday, when Mr. Orban s party bent parliamentary rules to pass a series of new laws without allotting enough parliamentary time for debate.  One law created a parallel judicial system, the latest of a series of broadsides against democratic norms that includes the reshaping of the electoral system in Mr. Orban s favor; the stacking of the Constitutional Court with Orban loyalists; and the erosion of media freedom and media plurality.  But the legislation that spurred the most anger among opposition lawmakers was the so called slave law that obligates employees to work up to 400 hours of overtime a year and gives employers up to three years to pay.  Trying to delay its passage and disrupt parliamentary business, opposition legislators blocked access to the speaker s podium and blew whistles. The law was ultimately voted through, but the pandemonium energized several thousand Hungarians to protest in subzero conditions, three nights in a row, in the square outside.  They took a break on Saturday, before an estimated 15,000 returned on Sunday    the highest numbers of the week.

In a radio interview Friday morning, Mr. Orban dismissed opposition to the changes as  hysterical shouting.

The protest extended into a second month   and a new year   a campaign emerging as one the most serious challenges yet to the authority of Viktor Orban, the four term prime minister.    Resign! Resign!   demonstrators chanted as a column of marchers stretching many city blocks made its way along Andrassy Avenue, the city s grand central boulevard. By late afternoon, the crowd had filled the sprawling plaza in front of the Hungarian Parliament, near the banks of the Danube.  Orban has helped pioneer a breed of autocracy in a country that threw off the shackles of communist authoritarianism three decades ago, and he serves as inspiration for other hard line leaders in Europe and beyond.   But the most important trigger for the demonstrations was legislation, jammed through the parliament last month with little debate, that allows employers to force workers to perform as many as 400 hours of overtime per year. Employers can delay payments for up to three years.  In advance of this weekend s protests, the Budapest police chief ordered a heightened state of alert, allowing officers to stop anyone, without suspicion, to check identification and search personal belongings.  Still, thousands braved wind, snow and freezing temperatures on Saturday to march from Heroes Square in central Budapest to the majestic Parliament building on the banks of the Danube. It was a diverse crowd, a mix of young and old, led by people frightened that their country was sliding into dictatorship.  Laszlo Kordas, the head of the Hungarian Trade Union Confederation, which has 150,000 members, said that although the political class and business elite had long been able to steer labor policies in their own direction, previous governments had never attempted something so brazen.

Passage of the law triggered mass protests from unions, opposition parties and civil society in December and January.  One such protest was held on Sunday as the prime minister spoke, though the crowd was smaller than the ones that had filled central Budapest squares in previous weeks.  Opponents say the labor law puts strain on home life by keeping parents from spending time with their children and runs counter to the government s insistence that it is family friendly.    If the government is serious about supporting families,   opposition lawmaker Bernadett Szel wrote on Facebook after Orban s speech,   it must start by withdrawing the family breaking slave law.

Opposition groups from both the pro European and pro Russian sides of the country s political divide united in the frigid weather to shout antigovernment slogans and demand new elections. The protests in the capital, Chisinau, were the latest to rack Moldova, an impoverished former Soviet republic between Ukraine and Romania, since November 2014, when an immense bank fraud with political implications came to light. The trigger for the latest wave of protests was the appointment of Pavel Filip as prime minister late Wednesday night, leading the country s third government in less than a year Shortly after Mr. Filip was sworn in, thousands of people surrounded the Moldovan Parliament, and a group of protesters broke through police cordons to get inside the building. Local media reports said the police used tear gas to dispel the crowd. But the demonstrations have continued outside the building despite the cold weather  Demonstrations in September drew more than 40,000 people, numbers rarely seen since the country gained independence in 1991. A protest site of around 300 tents, reminiscent of the protests in Independence Square in Kiev, sprang up outside the main government building, with Dignity and Truth taking the lead Protest leaders say they want the new government to resign by Thursday, but that is unlikely to resolve the major issues facing Moldova.   Protest leaders now face a dilemma,   Mr. Barbarosie said.   Moldova badly needs a functioning government, to negotiate with the country s foreign partners and plug the budget gaps to stop a social implosion.   He said he thought the most likely outcome would be a compromise of some kind, allowing Mr. Filip to stay on with promises of reform and a new election this year.   After Sunday s protests, Moldova s parliament speaker Andrian Candu called on the leaders to sit down at the negotiating table on Monday, but his proposal was rejected.  A pause in the protests was announced after this."

Though official statistics show hundreds of abortions performed legally in Poland each year, activists say tens of thousands more are performed on the black market or in neighboring countries.  This report contains material from Reuters and The Associated Press.    On Black Monday, as it was called, huge protests against the new legislation swept through 90 Polish cities.

Late Friday the country s parliament, where the Law and Justice  Pis  party has a majority, passed a bill giving parliament a greater say in appointing judges, which critics say violates the constitutional separation of powers.  Poland s government, elected in 2015 with 38 percent of the vote, appears to be on a collision course with the European Union. It has begun to pass bills that usurp the independence of the courts, giving the ruling party the ability to influence cases, punish its opponents, and stay in power. The sudden moves have led tens of thousands of Poles to take to the streets in protest. They have also shocked EU leaders, who never imagined a member state would violate a core principle of the Union. In fact, the EU has few tools to punish Poland. Brushing aside warnings from the European Union and ignoring tens of thousands of protesters in the streets, Poland s Parliament gave final approval to a landmark measure on Saturday that would restructure the Supreme Court, putting it under effective control of the governing party. The upper house was debating a draft law to dismiss supreme court judges and let the president replace them with his appointees. It was adopted by the lower house on Thursday, prompting protests by tens of thousands of people in Warsaw and other cities who condemned the move as a further step towards authoritarian rule under the nationalist Law and Justice  PiS  party.    Thousands of people have been systematically and peacefully demonstrating against the laws and the politicization of the judiciary,   said Kamila Gasiuk Pihowicz, a member of Parliament for Modern, an opposition party.   Poles suffered too long under Communism. There is no way that Polish citizens or the democratic opposition will allow this to happen to our country.    The protest sites scattered across Warsaw were only sparsely filled by early afternoon Saturday, as the previous night s much larger gatherings had lasted until near dawn.  Protesters in Warsaw have numbered in the tens of thousands most nights during the week of demonstrations, with smaller but still sizable gatherings in dozens of other cities. More are planned for this weekend.  Polish democracy won a partial, momentary reprieve on Monday when President Andrzej Duda vetoed two controversial bills that would have given the ruling Law and Justice party direct power over Poland s courts. Partial, because President Duda did sign a bill giving the Justice Ministry control over local courts. And momentary, because Mr. Duda has said he would introduce his own versions of the legislation soon. "

First, a Senate committee withdrew amendments to a bill, approved a day earlier, that would have pardoned officials imprisoned for bribery offenses.  Then, later in the day, the country s Constitutional Court upheld a law barring those with criminal convictions from serving as government ministers.  On Wednesday, the Romanian Senate s legislative affairs committee approved amendments to a draft bill on prison pardons to include the crimes of influence peddling and bribe taking. The bill is aimed at reducing prison overcrowding, but many Romanians worried that the amendments were the latest attempt to force through measures to reduce public officials  legal accountability.  About a thousand people took to the streets of Bucharest, the capital, to oppose the amendments, just months after protests rocked the country after the passage of an emergency measure relaxing penalties for official corruption.  Those protests in February, which at times drew more than half a million people and lasted for more than two weeks, were the largest the country had seen since the fall of communism more than two decades ago. The government rescinded the emergency decree and was forced to fend off a no confidence motion.  The protests on Wednesday were far smaller, but organizers said they were prepared to urge people to the streets if necessary. "

It was a thunderous roar that Russians were not happy with President Vladimir Putin s government.  Sunday, just a week later, small crowds here and there joined in   protest promenades.   It was kind of a whimper.  There was a demonstration in St. Petersburg and another in Novosibirsk, but generally the country was quiet.     "

Yet as the Sunday protests in Moscow and other cities proved, he has failed to crush the spirit and courage of Russian citizens who are willing to risk retribution to resist the excesses of his regime.  The anti government demonstrations were the largest in more than five years, drawing tens of thousands of people into the streets in scores of cities despite a sweeping ban on unsanctioned rallies. The protests called for the resignation of Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev; their proximate cause was a 50 minute video produced by Aleksei Navalny and other opposition allies and viewed more than 13 million times on social media. The video alleged that Mr. Medvedev had receive bribes from prominent oligarchs that enabled him to maintain fancy estates, vineyards and yachts in Russia and overseas. The protests also reflected broader public discontents, including unhappiness with the economy and the government s suppression of peaceful demonstrations.  The police response to the protests was predictably brutal. More than 1,000 demonstrators in Moscow were beaten and arrested, including Mr. Navalny. Although many of those detained were soon released, Mr. Navalny on Monday received a 15 day prison sentence for resisting arrest. "

MANAS, Russia   It stretched from horizon to horizon, like some giant, many colored, mechanical caterpillar, and it was angry, very angry. It was a long line of truck cabs, air horns booming, mighty engines revving, clogging the narrow highway that skirts the Caspian Sea coastline of the restive southern Russian province of Dagestan.  Their drivers, hundreds of them, were trying to send a message to a federal government that seems to tune out quieter civic protests, except to send police and national guardsmen in riot gear: Just you try to tune this out.  The truckers in this recent rally in Dagestan were part of a nationwide strike by thousands of drivers who say that a road tax, which the Russian government just increased, is making it impossible for them to earn a living. The drivers, who stopped working March27, complain that the tax is ineffective at best and suspicious, given that it s collected by a private company with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Like many of the protesters in the nationwide rallies against corruption that brought out tens of thousands on March 26, the truckers say their demands are economic, not political. And although the anti corruption protest was a one day event, the truckers are still out there.  In Dagestan, the lack of coverage is cause for distress. The drivers union leaders say more than 30,000 truckers have stopped work; 4,000 trucks are parked in and around this roadside town of Manas, the focal point of the protests. Magomed Ibragimov, who, like many of the protesters in Dagestan, owns his truck and operates as an independent contractor, spelled out the problem.  The protest has spread to more than 60 cities, said Ilya Shablinsky, a member of Russia s Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights.  Recent anti corruption demonstrations have occurred in more than 100 Russian cities, a strike by truckers is now in its third month, and a younger generation has grown less susceptible to television propaganda.

"," Thousands of demonstrators turned out in Russia on Saturday as part of nationwide protests two days before Vladimir V. Putin s inauguration for a fourth term as president.  In Moscow, the police clashed with protesters, turning a central square into a swirl of swinging nightsticks and shoving matches.  Protesters chanted,  Down with the czar!  And some wore paper crowns as a taunt against Mr. Putin s lengthy rule, now extending longer than any Russian leader since Stalin.  A group that monitors arrests, OVD Info, reported that by Saturday evening, the police had arrested 703 people in Moscow and about 1,600 throughout Russia. Among those arrested on Saturday was the opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, who had organized the rally, Russian news agencies reported. Despite crystalline spring weather, the Moscow turnout was smaller than an antigovernment rally before Mr. Putin s inauguration in 2012, which also ended in arrests.  Within minutes of the rally s start on Saturday, the police on loudspeakers declared it an illegal assembly.  Dear citizens, disperse,  a voice crackled.  Otherwise, force and special measures will be used.   Riot police officers formed wedges and began thrusting into the crowd and grabbing protesters seemingly at random. Thousands of people on Saturday marked President Vladimir Putin s upcoming fourth inauguration with street protests across Russia, defying a heavy police presence that detained more than 1,600 demonstrators.  Police dragged the organizer, 41 year old opposition leader Alexei Navalny, out of the Moscow rally by his arms and ankles minutes after he arrived. Protesters packed Pushkin Square in the center of the city nevertheless, and they were met by columns of riot police who charged into the crowd to try to disperse it.  Across the country, 1,612 people were detained in 26 cities, with more than 700 in the capital alone, according to the protest monitoring website OVD Info.    They re even worse than bandits   the people in power have made this country unfit for living,   said Natalia Znaminskaya, 58, editor of a regional journal in the Moscow suburbs.   No one can survive with these salaries, and in this environment.    Navalny s team organized 90 protests across the country, dubbing them   He is not our czar,   a reference to Putin, who was first elected president in 2000 and is already Russia s longest serving leader since Joseph Stalin.

Putin s typically monolithic ruling party.  The overhaul, which the government says is necessary to cope with a shrinking work force and a growing retiree population, has touched off street protests in more than 150 cities and divided the party, United Russia, usually known for its lock step unity. Unlike protests against corruption organized by the opposition politician Aleksei A. Navalny, which have rallied mostly young people, the pension protests have brought older Russians, often seen as Mr. Putin s base, into the streets.  The crowds have been small but angry. One woman protesting in Tver, a provincial city north of Moscow, suggested Russia follow China s example in dealing with corrupt bureaucrats:  In China, thieving officials are taken into the street and shot, and their property confiscated,  she said.

Braving a torrential summer downpour, the demonstrators joined what was called the March of the Mothers. They expressed concern that they could not protect their teenage children against what many consider to be an extensive online entrapment campaign by the Federal Security Service, or FSB, and other security agencies.   Freedom!  protesters chanted repeatedly when they reached the front of the Supreme Court after marching, mostly silently, down the middle of the Boulevard Ring in central Moscow.  Aleksei A. Makarov, a bearded, 33 year old schoolteacher, said entrapping teenagers was reminiscent of the Soviet tactics of the early 1950s, when his own grandmother was arrested at age 17 on accusations of participating in an illegal political group.   There is an overall course to increase repression, to repress any civic and political activity in the country,  said Mr. Makarov, who was carrying a small stuffed rhinoceros. Many demonstrators carried stuffed animals, especially unicorns, to symbolize that their march was about protecting children.  In what has become an increasingly popular tactic given the Moscow city government s refusal to issue demonstration permits, the event was a  protest stroll.   Participants walked in scattered ranks and avoided banners and mostly refrained from chanting to thwart attempts by the police to accuse them of participating in an illegal demonstration. In this case, the police hovered in the background and did not attempt to disrupt the protest.  The immediate cause of the demonstration was the arrest in March of two Moscow girls, Anna Pavlikova, 18, and Maria Dubovik, 19, on extremism charges in what has become known as the  New Greatness  case. Some people are incensed that they are being held without bail while in poor health.  "

Rioters overturned garbage containers, and broke traffic lights and store windows. They threw stones at the police, who responded with batons. According to the police, about 100 people were detained and a dozen suffered light injuries. But the violence was sporadic and the damage relatively minor.

National Police officers in riot gear clashed with two members of the Catalan regional force at a polling station in San Joan de Vilatorrada, 32 miles north of Barcelona. They shoved them aside as armed colleagues used truncheons to beat back protesters who had tried to stop them removing ballot boxes.  Similar scenes of officers forcing their way into polling stations played out at scores of venues across the region as Catalans defied a court order banning the vote as unconstitutional. At the Institute Pau in Barcelona riot policemen kicked, punched and pulled the hair of voters. One was accused of throwing a demonstrator down a flight of stairs before delivering a flying kick. In Barcelona riot police converging on a polling booth were forced back by a large, angry crowd. Protesters built a street barricade using sandbags and rubbish to try to prevent police arriving at the Escola Industrial school to confiscate ballot boxes.  One person was reported to be fighting for his life after suffering a heart attack and more than 760 people were hurt, three seriously, in clashes with police. Eleven officers were injured.

Earlier in the day, protesters blocked dozens of roads across Catalonia. Farmers used their tractors to cut off highways, and demonstrators shut down some of the main roads in Barcelona. The strike, which was backed by the regional government of Catalonia, also brought the subway system and bus network to a standstill during most of the working day.  The protests took place amid high tensions and widespread uncertainty after the highly disputed referendum, which was carried out in defiance of the central government in Madrid and which touched off clashes between the Spanish police and citizens who were trying to cast ballots.

Fifty barricades were placed across main roads, including the AP 7 motorway that crosses Catalonia. Hundreds of people surrounded the offices of the ruling conservative Popular Party in Barcelona and shouted:   Out, fascists!   Spanish national police, who were drafted into the region to enforce a court order banning Sunday s vote, were driven out of their hotels by crowds in Calella and Pineda de Mar, two towns near Barcelona.

The demonstration was organized by two pro independence groups, the National Catalan Assembly and Omnium Cultural. Their leaders are among nine separatists in prison awaiting trial for their roles in last year s failed breakaway bid by the northeastern Spanish region.  The regional chapters of Spain s two leading labor unions, along with other civil society groups, supported the protest, despite the complaints from some members who disagree with secession for Catalonia.

What we as labor unions are asking for now is dialogue.   The secession movement in the wealthy region has plunged Spain into its deepest institutional crisis in decades.  Separatist lawmakers defied court orders and held a referendum on independence in October. Their subsequent declaration of independence for the region led to a crackdown by the Spanish authorities, who said they were acting to defend the Spanish Constitution, which declares the nation  indivisible.   The protest was held to mark the six months that Jordi S nchez and Jordi Cuixart have spent incarcerated. Nine regional politicians are in prison.  It was one of the biggest demonstrations since the separatist unrest began last autumn. The local authorities estimated that 315,000 people assembled in the Pla a d Espanya for the midday march, with more than 950 buses bringing in supporters from across Catalonia. Among those present was Ada Colau, the mayor of Barcelona, Roger Torrent, the Catalan parliamentary speaker, and Artur Mas, the former regional president.  "

The police responded with tear gas. By early evening, at least one police van was burning on a central street in the city, and witnesses said people had been injured, though it was unclear how severely...By midnight, the streets were a scene of utter mayhem. Those fighting the police struck them with lengths of pipes and sticks, and hurled cobblestones the size of soccer balls into their midst. They sent fireworks whistling and sparking into their ranks, and threw what appeared to be firebombs, blossoming into flames when they struck. The police stumbled backward, patting at their clothes as fire burned their metal shields.

The men said they had been detained by riot police officers, stripped of their clothes and shot multiple times at close range with rubber bullets, then let go as a warning to others... ; 4   Most of the violence has unfolded a few hundred yards away, where a few hundred ultra nationalist protesters who call themselves the  Right Sector  have battled openly with police, using iron bars, stones, and Molotov cocktails. On Tuesday night they even deployed a medieval catapult, built according to instructions downloaded from the Internet, which managed to hurl only a few projectiles before being destroyed by police... ; 5   demonstrators in ski masks scuffled with the police here on Tuesday evening...riot police officers pushed past barricades of burned buses at that site and were met by a crowd of protesters in ski masks and bicycle helmets, carrying sticks and ready to fight. The police fired plastic bullets and threw stun grenades. They pressed as far as a cobblestone throwing catapult built by protesters the day before and dismantled it before retreating... ; 6   A deepening civil uprising in Ukraine turned deadly on Wednesday, and this embattled capital veered toward chaos, after at least three demonstrators died during clashes with the police and the first direct negotiations between President Viktor F. Yanukovich and opposition leaders yielded only threats and ultimatums. As Mr. Yanukovich met the three principal opposition leaders at the presidential headquarters on Wednesday afternoon, protesters and the police battled on a main street near the Dynamo soccer stadium. Flames from burning tires leapt into the air, beneath billows of black smoke, and there were sporadic explosions and gunfire, as the standoff entered its third day. Two protesters were shot and killed early Wednesday during the violence...The circumstances of their deaths were murky, but protesters said that the police had opened fire on them... ; 7   After continued clashes overnight, protesters battling the police in the Ukrainian capital agreed to the temporary cease fire on Thursday morning... ; 8   With President Viktor F. Yanukovych and antigovernment demonstrators at an impasse here, a cease fire disintegrated on Friday night as the Ukrainian capital convulsed in renewed violence and fire bombs lit up the night sky?  Officials say there are 3,000 to 4,000 specially trained Berkut officers, and an additional 8,000 to 9,000 Interior Ministry troops, deployed across the country...In Kiev, efforts to defuse the crisis suffered a major setback as the police fired rubber bullets at protesters near the Dynamo soccer stadium shortly after 10:30 p.m. on Friday, while demonstrators hurled stones, firebombs and even firecrackers... ; 9   The protests, while not clearly coordinated, were all in response to the increasingly ominous situation in Kiev, where demonstrators near the Dynamo soccer stadium had clashed fiercely with the police throughout this week, burning police buses, beating some officers and setting large numbers of tires on fire... ; 10   With mass protests spreading across the country, Mr. Yanukovych proposed one opposition figure, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, as prime minister and another, the former boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, as vice prime minister for humanitarian affairs.

Though far smaller than the Independence Square rallies of 2014, the new campaign has become the first sustained street movement since then. They are demanding that Parliament pass a law to establish the independent court for high level corruption cases and two other measures related to fighting corruption and making election campaigns more transparent.  The movement drew its largest crowd of about 5,000 people on Oct. 17, in a park near the Parliament building. At their peak, the 2014 demonstrations attracted crowds estimated at about 250,000 people.  Despite drawing far smaller crowds, the organizers have mimicked the earlier protests on Independence Square. The field kitchens doling out buckwheat stew and the tents warmed by wooden stoves, emblems of the previous rallies, today embody the accusation of unfulfilled promises. Clashes broke out near the Ukrainian Parliament in Kiev on Saturday, after police began removing a camp that was set up outside the government buildings last year to protest corruption.  As heavy snow fell on the makeshift site, protesters burned tires and scuffles broke out with police, who had moved in to dismantle the camp, which has been there for months.  More than 100 protesters were detained.  Nearly all were later released, but Kiev police reported that about 20 people, including seven police officers, were injured in the confrontation.  Early Saturday morning, police entered the area to investigative another violent incident that had taken place in February, in which several police officers were injured, said Andrey Kryshchenko, the head of the Kiev police.  On Friday, one day before the clash with the police, protesters had begun dismantling the tents by themselves after Parliament seemed to be leaning toward taking action on one of their major demands: creating a national anticorruption court. On Thursday, Parliament agreed to hear the first reading of legislation that would pave the way for the court.  But the entrance of the police into the camp on Saturday escalated simmering tensions. After tires were set alight, the police rounded up dozens of the protesters and began demolishing the camp with a tractor. "

The party offices were targeted because members of the Alliance Party at Belfast City Council voted in favour of the Union Jack being flown at City Hall only on designated days, such as the Queen s birthday. Previously the flag had been flown every day. Other offices in East Belfast belonging to Naomi Long, the party s only MP, were picketed and Laura McNamee, an Alliance Party councillor, was advised not to return to her home after threats were made on Facebook. Last night more rioting broke out in Belfast city centre after hundreds of loyalists took to the streets. Witnesses said that officers were pelted with stones, bottles and other missiles. Two cars were set on fire. Two police officers were injured, one of them hospitalised, during the clashes, which came after a man tried to drive a black van through a loyalist road block of about 200 people. There were also demonstrations in Bangor, Co Down, north and parts of south Belfast, and in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh. Police clashed with loyalists in Ian Paisley s home town of Ballymena, Co Antrim. The removal of the Union Jack led to riots across the Province throughout the week.

He said that ministers would be legally obliged to extend a deal struck for the struggling Virgin east coast line to other cash strapped companies. Lord Adonis quit the national infrastructure commission over the deal last week, claiming that it constituted a state bailout of Stagecoach, which owns 90 per cent of the franchise. The operator will be allowed to end the contract three years early after a predicted rise in passenger numbers failed to materialise, meaning that it will avoid  2 billion in franchise payments to the government.

Ms O Neill said:  The Ballymurphy families, 47 years later, are standing outside court to protest to have their rights respected.

Politicians from both the Conservative and Labour parties addressed the crowd, as did the UK s Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis.  Six months ago the outstanding decision was made by the Jewish community in London to protest in front of Parliament. Ever since, the situation has only worsened, so we felt that, as the second biggest Jewish community in the UK, it was Manchester s turn to say enough is enough,  Raphi Bloom, co chair of North West Friends of Israel, one of the organizers of the protest, told The Jerusalem Post.  People from all denominations have come together in this protest,  Bloom continued,  Religious, non religious, haredim and Reform. We are all standing together to make our voice heard.  The protest is a show of strength in light of the developments within the Labour party, he explained.  More and more people in power feel able to express things about Jews, the Jewish community, Jewish feelings without any repercussions.  Antisemitic attacks in the UK have reached an all time high over the last year, with nearly four incidents registered every day.  We won t be told how antisemitism should be defined,  Raphi explained.  We will say what we think antisemitism is. We re not going anywhere. The Jewish community has proudly dedicated itself and contributed to the UK for centuries. We re not going anywhere.  Nevertheless, when asked about what would happen if Corbyn would become prime minister in the next election, he replied that he believes many Jews will leave the country.  A few weeks ago, when Labour s shadow chancellor John McDonnell... was asked whether he could guarantee that he would keep up security funding for Jewish communities in case of becoming chancellor, he replied that  they would review all expenditures,   Bloom said.  That is outrageous.   Corbyn needs to say sorry. He needs to apologize for all he s done to the Jewish community. For calling Hamas his friends, for honoring the Munich terrorists, for allowing antisemitism to flourish. "
